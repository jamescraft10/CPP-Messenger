so the code is going to served on a port which is connected to and our server (server.c) is going to have a api so with fetch and js on the front end then can be a libary thats going to be used as a replacement for socket io


socket io thing.
.frontend {
    use fetch to send request from the server and to get data idk
}

.backend {
    store the current message
    transfer messages to everyone on request
}
